# Running the application

The pre-assignment was implemented as a web-application  optimized both for desktop and mobile users. 

The application is running at: https://amielonen.github.io/BTCapp/
The source code can be accessed through Github: https://github.com/amielonen/BTCapp/tree/main/src

# Technology choices

I chose a web-based solution since building the application to web allows using it on any device and OS.

React was chosen as the development framework because its the most familiar web development framework to me. Furhtermore, it excels at building simple and powerful frontends as the assignment required mostly front-end development for the provided API. However, the app was built with basic React features and I chose not to use any libraries or dependecies, as the goal of the project was to showcase my understanding of the chosen language/framework.
